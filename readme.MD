_ScratchDB is down, so stats aren't accurate_

Please use command: ```pip install scratchattach```
Please use command: ```pip install flask flask-cors```


If you don't have python, download it at https://www.python.org/downloads/
		TIP:  download 3.13.1 because the code may not work for older versions

First run backend.py

Then run index.html to access

#WARNINGS:

Do NOT close backend.py when opened index.html, may cause crashes otherwise!

Close ANY antivirus or firewall because they will interfere with any local or imports.

Do NOT run this in sandbox, otherwise it will stop the program from accessing scratchattach

If any error happens, it is your fault. I have tested the program.
